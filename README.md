# safely

cope with deficiencies of functional interfaces

## about

This package contains a set of utilities for working with
lambdas that may throw (un)checked exceptions. This includes:

* Safely – a utility for wrapping lambdas
* SafeCallable – an interface similarly to java.util.concurrent.Callable, that does not throw checked exceptions
* WrappingException – an exception that easily wraps around (probably checked) exceptions

For further instructions, use the source, Luke!
(but examples will be added in the near future)
